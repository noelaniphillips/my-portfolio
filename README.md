**Data Science Intern @ Salesforce (_May 2024 - August 2024_)**
- Revamped a revenue-forecasting tool using Python and SQL that automated the sales quota allocation process for over 4,000 sales strategy employees. 
- Improved XGBoost model’s performance against business logics by 14% with simplified pre-processing logic, targeted feature selection, and regularization for zero-inflated data.
- Led cross-functional collaboration with product manager and stakeholders to align model capabilities with business needs and integrate the final product into planning dashboards like AnaPlan. 

**Machine Learning Researcher @ Carnegie Mellon University (_November 2023 - May 2024_)**
- Developed a deep learning system simulating Bayer’s supply chain that identified weak nodes through stress-testing and improved supply chain resilience. 
- Trained a Graph Neural Network (GNN) using PyTorch and TensorFlow on over 250,000 high-impact disruption scenarios, predicting the monetary impact with an accuracy of 84%.  
- Analyzed Time to Recovery (TTR) metric to pinpoint nodes whose failure would have the largest impact and suggest alternative paths, reducing potential financial loss by up to 9.2% per node.

  
**Data Analyst Intern @ Cognitive and Social Development Lab CMU (_May 2023 - August 2023_)**
- Modeled how children acquire and organize new semantic knowledge through a comprehensive analysis of three language corpora, each containing 8-13 million words, with Python, R, and NLTK.
- Conducted hypothesis tests and built visualizations to compare the performances of two probability-based word association measures, presenting results to a lab of over 15 researchers and informing future research efforts.
