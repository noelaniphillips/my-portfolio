## Work Experience


**(Upcoming) Data Science Intern @ Reddit (_May 2025 - August 2025_)**
- Ads Platform Team

**Data Science Intern @ Salesforce (_May 2024 - August 2024_)**
- Revamped a revenue-forecasting tool using Python and SQL that automated the sales quota allocation process for over 4,000 sales strategy employees. 
- Improved XGBoost model’s performance against business logics by 14% with simplified pre-processing logic, targeted feature selection, and regularization for zero-inflated data.
- Led cross-functional collaboration with product manager and stakeholders to align model capabilities with business needs and integrate the final product into planning dashboards like AnaPlan.


**Machine Learning Researcher @ Carnegie Mellon University (_November 2023 - May 2024_)**
- Developed a deep learning system simulating Bayer’s supply chain that identified weak nodes through stress-testing and improved supply chain resilience. 
- Trained a Graph Neural Network (GNN) using PyTorch and TensorFlow on over 250,000 high-impact disruption scenarios, predicting the monetary impact with an accuracy of 84%.  
- Analyzed Time to Recovery (TTR) metric to pinpoint nodes whose failure would have the largest impact and suggest alternative paths, reducing potential financial loss by up to 9.2% per node.


**Data Analyst Intern @ Carnegie Mellon University Cognitive Development Lab (_May 2023 - August 2023_)**
- Modeled how children acquire and organize new semantic knowledge through a comprehensive analysis of three language corpora, each containing 8-13 million words, with Python, R, and NLTK.
- Conducted hypothesis tests and built visualizations to compare the performances of two probability-based word association measures, presenting results to a lab of over 15 researchers and informing future research efforts.

## Projects
### Racial Identity Profiling in Contra Costa County (R)
[Poster](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/capstoneresearch/spring2024/490files/poster2.pdf)

Earned 3rd Place Prize in Undergraduate Statistics Research at CMU's Meeting of the Minds

- Uncovered patterns of racial and ethnic disproportionality in police stops with linear/logistic regression, hypothesis tests, and decision trees in R to make policy recommendations to Contra Costa’s Office of Justice. 
- Performed sensitivity analyses to ensure robustness of findings despite variation in demographic data sources.

### Behind Schedule: An Investigation into Pittsburgh Regional Transit Performance (Python)
[Repo](https://github.com/noelaniphillips/pittsburgh-bus-project/tree/main)

- Sourced, cleaned, and built visualizations of key performance metrics with pandas and altair to evaluate the quality of Pittsburgh Regional Transit's bus and rail services.
- Tracked On-Time Performance (OTP) and identified disparities, such as the poor OTP of CMU-centric bus routes compared to system-wide averages, and evaluated temporal, seasonal, and day-type influences on OTP.
